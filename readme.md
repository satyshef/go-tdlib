## Introduction
Telegram Tdlib is a complete library for creating telegram clients, it also has a simple tdjson ready-to-use library to ease
the integration with different programming languages and platforms.

**tdlib** is a complete tdlib-tdjson binding package to help you create your own Telegram clients.

**NOTE:** basic tdjson-golang binding is inspired from this package: [go-tdjson](https://github.com/L11R/go-tdjson)

All the classes and functions declared in [Tdlib TypeLanguage schema](https://github.com/tdlib/td/blob/master/td/generate/scheme/td_api.tl)
file have been exported using the autogenerate tool [tl-parser](https://github.com/Arman92/go-tl-parser).
So you can use every single type and method in Tdlib.
